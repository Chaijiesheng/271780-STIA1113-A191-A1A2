# Introduction

Through this assignment ,i learn how to apply for loop , while loop and if statement to complete my assignment.
This assignment is making a car loan calculator to compute the amount of monthly repayment and generate principal , 
interest and balance loan repayment table, by year . Before we start to coding ,a clear pseudocode and flow chart is 
prefer to make , because it can simplify our work . By using while loop ,you can limit the input from the user by keep 
looping until the user enter the proper amount for calculate the monthly repayment .You just need to enter the car price
, down payment amount , car loan period and loan interest rate , and then you can easily get the monthly repayment and 
the whole repayment table.
